## Python Boss Challenge

In this challenge, you get to be the boss. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

The task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records.

In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.
The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
